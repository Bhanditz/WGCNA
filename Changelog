Note: as of 2009/03/10, changes that lead to different calculational results are marked as DIFF.


2011/08/16: 1.12

	. Code cleanup to satisfy CRAN package check
	. Functions plot.cor and plot.mat renamed to plotCor and plotMat to avoid 
	  confusion with methods for the plot generic
	. Function userListEnrichment now returns a slightly more informative
	  output in which the type of the refrence category is also indicated.


2011/07/06: 1.11-3

	. bugfix in modulePreservation fixes an additional bug that was introduced in 1.11-1 
	. bugfix in votingLinearPredictor: function now produces valid output
	  when some (but not all!) features have zero variance
	. fixed names of output in votingLinearPredictor

2011/06/06: 1.11-2

	. bugfix in blockwiseConsensusModules fixes a crash of the function

2011/05/31: 1.11-1

	. bugfix in modulePreservation fixes internal errors that appeared under certain circumstances
	. small changes in compiled code should make the code compatible with older gcc versions

2011/05/11: 1.11

	. bugfix in conformityDecomposition: calculation corrected
	. bugfix in userListEnrichment: internal data sets are now used
	  correctly
	. bugfix in collapseRows that affected the group2row component in the returned value.
	  The bug caused some of the returned representative rows to be incorrect but had
	  no effect on the collapsed data.
	. bicor now issues a warning when any of the input variables 
	  (or their columns) have zero MAD.
	. numbers2colors gains the argument commonLim to specify whether
	  limits should be column-specific or universal
	. bug fix in numbers2colors: having missing data and out of range data
	  at the same time will not cause an error anymore


2011/04/2: 1.10-2

	. Bug in function cor fixed that caused an unncessary slowdown. Results were not affected.
	. Typos in several help files fixed: use = 'Spearman' is now corrected

	  chooseOneHubInEachModule, consensusDissTOMandTree, kMEcomparisonScatterplot, 
	  moduleMergeUsingKME, orderBranchesUsingHubGenes, overlapTableUsingKME,
	  stratifiedBarplot, swapTwoBranches, reflectBranches, selectBranch, userListEnrichment
	. New function mutualInfoAdjacency by Lin Song
	. New functions coClustering and coClustering.permutationTest
	. Due to excessive problems with Tcl/Tk, we dropped the dependency on
	  package qvalue and incorporated the necessary R code directly into
	  WGCNA
	. plotColorUnderTree and plotDendroAndColors gain additional
	  flexibility when working with rows of text labels. 
	. The argument 'colorText' to the above functions has been renamed to
	  'rowText'. Sorry for any code that becomes broken because of this!
	. VerboseScatterplot gains arguments to set the regression line color and type.
	. Colors for text labels in labeledHeatmap can now be set.

2011/02/05: 1.00

	. Functions standardScreeningBinaryTrait and standardScreeningNumericTrait can now optionally turn
	  off the calculation of q-values as the latter sometimes leads to problems.
	. Character expansion for axis labels in labeledHeatmap can be set separately 
	  for x and y axis.

2010/12/17: 0.99

	. Functions [bi]cor gain the ability to calculate cosine [bi]correlations, 
	  invoked using the argument cosine = TRUE. Similar functionality added

	  For most other functions using correlations, the argument corOptions can be 
	  used to request cosine correlations.
	. Corrected error message in function adjacency
	. Functions [bi]corAndPvalue now also return the number of
	  observations for each p-value

2010/11/12: 0.98

	  when input y = NULL
	. Functions [bi]corAndPvalue now also return the Student t statistic
	  from which the p-values are calculated. 
	. Function standardScreeningNumericTrait now accepts arguments corFnc
	  and corOptions

2010/10/29: 0.97

	. Functions [bi]corAndPvalue now also return the Fisher Z statistics.
	. Function adjacency can now calculate distance-based networks as well, 
	  via type="distance". Various distance functions and options can be used.
	. Functions signedKME and networkScreening now accept arguments cor
	  and corOptions that can be used to specify the correlation function
	  to be used in the calculations.
	. Argument 'y' in [bi]corAndPvalue now has a default value NULL
	. DIFF: displayed value of correlation p-value in function
	  verboseScatterplot is now based on Student distribution instead of
	  Fisher normal approximation. This change only affects plots.

2010/09/23: 0.96

	. New functions pquantile, pmean, pmedian for calculation of
	  "parallel" quantiles, means, and medians.
	. Functions cor and bicor now give a more descriptive error description when 
	  an argument with one dimension equal zero is passed to the functions.

2010/09/16: 0.95

	. More changes to function collapseRows: renamed arguments, changed defaults, 
	  code cleaned up and bugs fixed. The function collapseRows should still be
	  considered experimental.

2010/09/05: 0.94

	. DIFF: big fixed in modulePreservation that put incorrect input into
	  Zconnectivity.preservation which also affected Zsummary. We apologize
	  for this error.
	. Bug fixes in function collapseRows

2010/08/25: 0.93

	. modulePreservation now also calculates density and connectivity
	  statistics based on clustering coefficient and maximum adjacency
	  ratio.
	. New functions mutualInfoAdjacency and AUV2predicted provide basic
	  interfacing between mutual information methods and weighted networks
	. Minor cleanup of help files

2010/07/26: 0.92-3

	. Package file cleanup, nothing changed from user perspective

2010/07/14: 0.92-1

	. Bug in compiled calculation of adjacency fixed. This may have
	  affected calculations of TOM when TOMType = "signed". Apologies if
	  important results were affected.

2010/06/24: 0.92

	. DIFF: in modulePreservation, by default Zsummary is only calculated
	  from meanAdj, cor.kIM and cor.Adj.
	. DIFF: in modulePreservation, a new option includekMEallInSummary (default FALSE)
	  controls whether cor.kMEall should be included in summary statistis
	. output of modulePreservation now has names in permutationDetails to facilitate 
	  detailed studies of permutation results

2010/06/10: 0.91

	. DIFF: in modulePreservation, values of cor.kME, cor.kMEall and
	  meanSignAwarekME are now stripped of their sign, both in observed
	  values and in permutations. This is done because the eigengene may
	  flip sign between data sets, leading to artificially low
	  preservation scores. 
	. DIFF: p-values calculated by modulePreservation are now returned as logarithms in base 10
	  (previously they were returned as natural logarithms). Names of the returned components also
	  changed slightly to emphasize that the p-values are returned as logarithms.
	. Additional summarycolumns added to the output of modulePreservation 
	  for observed and permutation preservation statistics
	. Function collapseRows now selects a single probe to represent each gene

2010/06/05: 0.90

	. modulePreservation now also returns p-values and optionally the q-values corresponding to the
	  permutation Z scores
	. simulateDatExpr now sets (artificial) gene and sample names, for easier integration with some	
	  analysis functions (notably modulePreservation)
	. incompatibilities with new versions of R in exportNetworkTo[Visant,Cytoscape] fixed 
	. new function subsetTOM to efficiently calculate TOM among a subset
	  of network nodes 
	. bugs in vectorTOM fixed
	. DIFF: modulePreservation now limits the size of the gold module to
	  at most half the total number of genes in the comparison, to make
	  sampling and permutation calculations meaningful. This may slightly affect
	  calculated results for the gold module, but will not affect results of
	  any other modules.


2010/05/21: 0.89

	. DIFF: definition of cluster coefficient has been slightly changed,
	  which affects approximate conformity-based network concepts
	. new functions rankPvalue and metaZfunction

	  that often led to errors
	. new function collapseRows by Jeremy Miller to convert probe-level
	  expression to gene-level expression

2010/05/07: 0.88-2

	. unnecessary dependence on package fields removed. 

2010/05/07: 0.88-1

	. DIFF: bug in cor(x) and bicor(x) fixed that produced incorrect results
	  when a column of x was all missing (NA). We aplogize for any incovenience
	  this error may have caused.

2010/03/17: 0.88

	. new functions corAndPvalue and bicorAndPvalue that calculate (bi)correlation p-values efficiently
	  for matrices of correlations


2010/02/19: 0.87

	. bicor gets a new argument pearsonFallback that lets the user specify 
	  the handling of cases with zero median absolute deviation that would
	  normally lead to NA values.
	. mergeCloseModules (and blockwise[Consensus]Modules) now more robust: 
	  works also in the case of a single module
	. DIFF: A bug was fixed that affected bicor(x) calculation with missing data on Windows
	  (calculations of 2-variable bicor, single-variable bicor without missing data, and any 
	   calculations where multi-threading is available [most platforms except Windows] were 
	   not affected by this bug). The bug caused some calculations to be a bit off. 
	   We apologize for any problems this may have caused.

2010/02/10: 0.86

	. bug in colQuantileC fixed.
	. EXPERIMENTAL: a major addition to modulePreservation now allows
	  module preservation calculations based on general adjacency matrices.

	  meaning of 'offs' in help file

2009/11/24: 0.83-1

	  the node file (thanks to Tim Gernat for pointing it out and suggesting
	  the fix)

2009/10/22: 0.81-1

	. addTraitToMEs now works with colnames instead of names
	. bugfix in bicor(x): when x has missing data, bicor now does not crash
	. minor bugfix in plotEigengeneNetworks: printAdjacency is now respected

2009/10/19: 0.81

	. several functions from the now defunct package sma were added, mainly
	  to allow our users to run all tutorials smoothly. Note that if 
	  sma package is used concurrently, identical copies of the duplicated 
	  functions will be available. Warning messages about this fact can be 
	  disregarded safely.
	. labeledHeatmap re-written to use an internal heatmapWithLegend
	  function. This means labeledHeatmap now works also in complicated
	  sectionings using layout(), which was not the case before.

2009/09/18: 0.80-1

	. crash in blockwise[Consensus]Modules and TOM calculations when using
	  bicor fixed; blockwise[Consensus]Modules and TOM calculations using
	  compiled code get a new argument maxPOutliers corresponding to the
	  bicor argument of the same name (see news in 0.80).

2009/09/13: 0.80

	. overlapTable now works when the arguments are 1xn or nx1 matrices.

2009/08/07: 0.79-3

	. GOenrichmentAnalysis now works for yeast data as well. Yeast GO
	  mappings are given in a slightly different database (ORF identifiers
	  instead of Entrez) and previous versions of the function did not
	  handle this difference (thanks to Maryam Anwar for pointing this out).

2009/08/05: 0.79-2

	. Default color in addGuideLines now darker ((grey30 instead of grey70).
	. Default color in addGrid now darker (grey30 instead of grey70).
	. Error in bicor help file corrected.
	. moduleEigengenes gets the option to turn off scaling expression data

	. Minor changes to diagnostic messages in TOM calculations
	. Minor changes to printed values in verboseBoxplot
	. GOenrichmentAnalysis a bit more stable
	. GOenrichmentAnalysis can now analyze several sets of labels at the same time;

	  for a collection of competing module assignments. 
	. Enrichment calculations can optionally be restricted to a subset of modules

2009/06/05: 0.79-1

	. GOenrichmentAnalysis now faster and a bug in returned genePositions fixed.
	. function plotEigengeneNetworks gained two additional arguments controling the printing of
	  numerical values into the adjacency heatmaps.

2009/06/01: 0.79

	. Added (experimental) function GOenrichmentAnalysis for automatic GO enrichment
	  analysis

	. Hubgene calculation in moduleEigengenes now works even if only
	  one gene has valid data.
	. Bug in labeledBarplot fixed that crashed the function if no error bars were given.

2009/05/05: 0.77

	. DIFF: reverting to default TOM denominator method "min"
	. Bug fix in .clustOrder affecting consensusOrderMEs and
	  mergeCloseModules when there is only one proper module present.

2009/04/02: 0.76

	. Display of p-value in verboseScatterplot improved: small p values now shown more accurately
	. Spurious warning message in matchLabels is now suppressed
	. additional TOM option added: use mean denominator instead of minimum

	. fixed a bug in matchLabels that caused unrelated modules to be
	  matched
	. faster correlation calculations are now implemented both for [bi]cor(x)
	  as wellas [bi]cor(x,y). On platforms where POSIX threads are
	  available, certain parts of the [bi]cor calculations are threaded
	. functions [bi]cor, blockwise[Consensus]Modules, TOMsimilarityFromExpr
	  now have additional parameters providing control over threading and
	  over the tradeoff between speed and precision in handling missing data
	  in the correlation calculations
	. fixed a bug in bicor(x,y) that was present when any of the columns
	  consisted of only missing data and that caused incorrect NAs and 0s
	  in the result.
	. DIFF: softConnectivity now subtracts 1 from the sum of adjacencies to remove 
	  the adjacency of a gene with itself.
	. DIFF: order of parameters in softConnectivity has changed.
	. DIFF: default number of centers in [consensus]projectiveKMeans is
	  now an attempt to fully utilize resources estimated from preferredSize.
	. softConnectivity now accepts parameter 'type' that can specify the
	  network type to be used;
	. fixed a bug in function adjacency that would crash the function in
	  certain circumstances.

2009/03/04: 0.73

	. default p value threshold in matchLables relaxed to 5e-2
	. DIFF: [consensus]ProjectiveKMeans now default to a much higher number
	  since that seems to lead to better results.

	  to best approximate module labels in a given reference partition

2009/02/06: 0.71-1

	. minor changes in verbosity of TOM calculations
	. blockwise[Consensus]Modules: random seed is now set only if it is non-NULL; this allows the
	  user to force the functions to run without setting a seed, which was not possible before.

2009/02/05: 0.71

	. package flashClust that implements fast hierarchical clustering is now required and used
	  throughut.

2009/01/29: 0.70

	. adapted for dynamicTreeCut-1.20: PAM stage in the dynamic tree cut
	  used in blockwise module detection functions can now optionally
	  respect the dendrogram  in the sense an object can be PAM-assigned
	  only to clusters that lie below it on the branch that the object is
	  merged into. Note that this requires dynamicTreeCut 1.20 or higher.
	. TOM calculation: "Rough guide to max array..." now respects verbose parameter

2009/01/25: 0.67-2

	. bug in recutBlockwiseTrees fixed (only visible if some genes or samples were bad)

	  table is given.

2008/11/02: 0.65-1

	  the center with highest index became empty
	. numbers2colors resistant to values out of range of the given min and max.
	. p-value in verboseScaterplot now corresponds to the actual correlation printed instead of
	  the Pearson correlation value. However, the p-values are always calculated assuming the
	  correlation value is actually Pearson. 

2008/09/18: 0.63

	. [automaticN|n]etworkScreening now accept option getQValue that can be used to turn off q value 
	  calculations; they also report counts of module eigengenes with gene
	  significances in specific intervals.

2008/09/17: 0.62-1

	. C implementation of column quantile (i.e., apply(data, 2, quantile)) giving immense speedup

	. blockwise functions now complete all blocks even if there is a block
	  with no modules detected or with an error during ME calculation.
	. consensusProjectiveKMeans can now optionally use mean as definition
	  of consensus distance, improving convergence in multiple set situations
	. several help files added
	. bicor now implemented consistently in R code and in compiled code:

	  consistently. Functions bicov and bicorNAy are removed. 
	. pickSoftThreshold now accepts networkType argument
	. blockwiseConsensusModules can now optionally save samples used for TOM scaling
